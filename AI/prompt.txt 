PRIMARY GOAL:
Replace the model with the USER while preserving identity and realism.

SOURCE IMAGE (USER):
- Use this uploaded user face/full‑body photo as the identity reference: [USER_IMAGE_REFERENCE].
- Preserve unique facial features, skin tone, hairline, eye shape, and proportions; no beautification unless requested.

PRIMARY SUBJECT:
A photorealistic, full‑body image of the USER standing naturally and relaxed, confident posture, straight‑on eye‑level camera, hands visible, no stiff mannequin vibes.

FEATURED PRODUCT (DESCRIPTION-BASED REPLACEMENT):
Wear and integrate the following product into the outfit: “[USER_PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION_TEXT]”.
Blend realistically into the attire with correct placement, scale, shadows, fabric interaction, and body contact.

EXISTING BASE ATTIRE (ASSUMED):
Assume a stylish contemporary outfit: well‑fitting shirt (unspecified style) and complementary pants (unspecified style).
Make the described product the visual focus while keeping the base outfit cohesive.

POSE & FRAMING:
Full‑body, straight-on, neutral stance with subtle weight shift; keep limbs fully in frame with natural foreshortening.

ENVIRONMENT & BACKGROUND:
Professional minimalist studio on seamless paper in light gray/beige/off‑white; soft, even, flattering light; no harsh shadows; clean floor gradient.

ART STYLE & QUALITY:
Hyper‑realistic, high‑detail, sharp focus, high‑end commercial fashion photography, 8K look.

IDENTITY & FACE INTEGRATION:
- Precisely align and blend the USER face onto a contextually appropriate body with consistent lighting, color, and grain.
- Match neck tone, jawline contour, and hair edges; avoid haloing and blur; keep expression neutral‑pleasant.
- Maintain body proportions consistent with source reference; no exaggerated slimming/elongation.

WARDROBE BEHAVIOR:
- Respect garment drape, folds, and stretch; ensure realistic contact shadows at cuffs, collar, waistband, and accessory touch points.
- If product is eyewear, ensure correct lens scale, temple angle over ears, and mild catchlights; if jewelry, maintain correct metal reflections; if scarf, show natural layering and occlusion on torso/neck.

OPTIONAL CONTROLS (if supported):
- Guidance strength for image‑to‑image identity lock: medium‑high.
- Face restoration/detailing: subtle.
- Seed locked for reproducibility.

NEGATIVE PROMPT (AVOID):
nsfw, explicit, nude, suggestive, provocative; low quality, blurry, watermark, signature, text; extra limbs, fused fingers, bad anatomy, deformed, distorted features, unrealistic proportions; over‑smoothing, plastic skin, mismatched skin tones, lighting mismatch between face and body; product appearing detached or poorly integrated into the outfit.
