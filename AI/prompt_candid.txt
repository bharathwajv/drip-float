Use the uploaded user photo [USER_IMAGE_REFERENCE] as the identity reference. Produce a single photorealistic landscape image (16:9 aspect ratio, optimized for 1024x576) with the USER as the model. Preserve unique facial features, skin tone, hairline, eye shape, and proportions; no beautification unless requested.

### Primary subject

* Full-body photorealistic portrait of the USER in a professional studio, but with casual, candid energy.
* Confident yet relaxed body language: natural weight shift, hands visible, no mannequin stiffness.
* Expression neutral-pleasant, but open to subtle candid variations (soft smile, mid-motion gesture, natural glance).

### Clothing & product integration

* Base outfit: stylish contemporary shirt and complementary pants (well fitted).
* Integrate the featured product described as "[USER_PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION_TEXT]" as the visual focus. Blend realistically with correct placement, scale, fabric interaction, shadows, and body contact.
* Add tasteful accessories (watch, belt, minimal jewelry, socks, shoes) that harmonize with the product.

### Creative styling cues (casual studio candids)

* Folded-hands casual: hands loosely folded at waist or chest, natural sleeve folds.
* Hands in pockets: one or both hands casually in pockets, relaxed shoulders.
* Jacket adjustment: mid-action adjusting cuff, sleeve, or collar.
* Shoe-forward stance: one leg subtly forward, shoe slightly emphasized, candid mid-shift.
* Looking away candid: user glances slightly off-camera, natural posture.
* Accessory interaction: checking a watch, adjusting eyewear, or resting hand on wrist.

### Pose & framing

* Full-body, straight-on but allow slight angle or subtle mid-motion stance for candid realism.
* Frame and compose for 16:9 landscape, leaving headroom and balanced spacing.
* Camera: eye-level, slightly wide lens for natural perspective, no distortion.

### Lighting & background

* Professional minimalist studio: seamless backdrop in light gray/beige/off-white.
* Soft, flattering light with gentle shadows and floor gradient.
* Keep consistent tone between reference face and generated body.

### Identity & face integration

* Precisely align and blend USER face with natural skin tone, hair edges, and jawline contour.
* Avoid halo, blur, or mismatched light.
* Keep expression candid but natural (slight smile, soft gaze, neutral-pleasant).

### Wardrobe realism

* Maintain authentic drape, folds, and stretch in clothing.
* Respect contact shadows at cuffs, waistband, accessories, and shoes.
* For eyewear: natural lens reflections and correct ear/temple alignment.
* For jewelry: realistic reflections, metal shine.

### Output specs & controls
