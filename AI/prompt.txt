Use the uploaded user photo [USER_IMAGE_REFERENCE] as the identity reference. Produce a single photorealistic landscape image (16:9 aspect ratio, optimized for 1024x576) with the USER as the model. Preserve unique facial features, skin tone, hairline, eye shape, and proportions; no beautification unless requested.
Primary subject
* Full-body photorealistic portrait of the USER standing naturally and relaxed, confident posture, straight-on eye-level camera. Hands visible - avoid stiff mannequin poses.
* If the composition benefits, include one creative close-up variant focused on shoes or wrist - see variants below - but final deliverable must be landscape format and framed for 16:9.
Clothing & product integration
* Base outfit: stylish contemporary shirt and complementary pants (well fitted).
* Integrate the featured product described as "[USER_PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION_TEXT]" as the visual focus. Blend realistically: correct placement, scale, fabric interaction, shadows, and body contact.
* Add subtle, tasteful accessories as needed (watch, belt, socks, minimalist jewelry) that match the outfit and product.
Creative styling cues (choose 1-2)
* Folded-hands casual: user folds hands lightly at waist or chest, sleeves naturally creased, relaxed shoulders.
* One-leg-forward weight shift: subtle hip shift for natural foreshortening.
* Shoe-closeup option: crop slightly tighter left-right but keep 16:9; foreground shoe detail with shallow depth-of-field while keeping face readable in background.
* Accessorize: add matching pants fabric texture and a watch on the wrist nearest camera; if product is eyewear, add realistic reflections and lens scale.
* If product is small (shoe, watch, ring) place product in visual focal plane using shallow depth of field and realistic occlusion.
Pose & framing
* Full-body, straight-on, neutral stance with subtle weight shift; ensure limbs are fully in frame with natural foreshortening.
* Frame and compose for landscape 16:9: leave generous headroom and space in front of body for product emphasis.
* Camera: eye-level, slightly wide lens (natural perspective), avoid distortion.
Lighting & background
* Professional minimalist studio on seamless paper in light gray/beige/off-white; soft even flattering light, gentle fill, clean floor gradient; no harsh shadows or colored gels.
* Ensure consistent lighting between face reference and body - match skin tone, grain, and shadow direction.
Identity & face integration
* Precisely align and blend the USER face onto a contextually appropriate body with consistent lighting and grain.
* Match neck tone, jawline contour, hair edges; avoid haloing, blur, or mismatched color.
* Keep expression neutral-pleasant; no over-smoothing or plastic skin.
Wardrobe realism
* Respect garment drape, folds, stretch; ensure realistic contact shadows at cuffs, collar, waistband, and accessory contact areas.
* For eyewear, ensure temple angle fits over ears; for jewelry, render correct metal reflections and small catchlights.
Output specs & controls
* Output: single file, landscape 16:9 (1024x576), high detail, hyper-realistic, commercial fashion quality.
* Guidance strength: medium-high for identity lock.
* Face restoration/detailing: subtle.
* Seed: locked for reproducibility, if supported.
Negative prompt (avoid)
* nsfw, explicit, nude, sexualized or suggestive content
* low quality, blurry, watermark, signature, text
* extra limbs, fused fingers, bad anatomy, deformed or distorted features
* mismatched skin tones, lighting mismatch between face and body
* over-smoothing or plastic skin
* product detached or poorly integrated
Optional creative variants (pick one to generate alongside main image)
1. Folded hands full-body - slightly wider frame to show sleeve detail and watch.
2. Shoe-forward closeup - foreground shoe detail with soft bokeh but landscape crop; face remains readable.
3. Waist-up plus hands - crop tighter vertically but still landscape; emphasizes product at torso or hand.
4. Accessory-focused - highlight watch/bracelet with wrist near camera, realistic reflections and shadowing.
